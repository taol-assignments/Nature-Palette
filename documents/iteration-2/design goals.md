#### Reliability:
System should remain useful in many unexpected situations. for example, when a large number of users upload file at the same time, system should promise a rapid response and handle files correctly.
#### flexibility:
System should be easy to extend (new functions, new platforms). for example, administrator can add new search terms to extend the search function.
#### Robustness:
System has ability to cope with errors during execution or erroneous input. developers should adopt robust programming. that means the code should handle unexpected terminations and actions gracefully by displaying accurate error messages.
#### Runtime efficiency:
System can adopt efficient algorithms to do calculation, and try to use lesser resources to handle more requests.
#### cohesion and coupling:
System should be high in cohesion, an dlow in coupling. the code should be wrapped into modules, each module provide an object for others to use. the context that use the object don't need to know how it accomplishes.
