#### Adaptability:
when change occurs, the system should be able to adapt itself fast and efficiently to fit with the occurring change.
#### Compatibility:
System can run across different platforms (windows, linux and so on), and the front-end should be compatible with different browsers (eg. IE, firefox).
#### Good documentation:
The organization and documentation of
the system should then make it easier for new developers to contribute
features to the code. This includes source code documentation that supports low-level
changes and improvements, as well as a good architecture-level documentation that
supports the addition of new features. This design goal originated from the developers.
